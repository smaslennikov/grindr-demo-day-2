# GoCD & Jenkins

Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery tools

# Proofs of Concept

- have requirements
- ability to abandon
- fail/succeed strongly

---
# GoCD PoC requirements

- pipelines as code
- secret storage
- stability and long term support

---
# GoCD PoC failures

- can't store SSH keys/secret variables
- pipeline prompt enforcement
- few users, few problem-solutions

---
# PoC outcome

- failure is success
- Jenkins PoC
